## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Python is a highlevel programmimg language because it is in layman language and the compiler convert this in to 0 and 1 which can be understand by computer.


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Because there is no need to do variable declaration in python.The Python itself interprets the variable
Eg:a=10


Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Prons:
Easy to learn
Doesn’t need to remember syntax unlike for other languages
Robust

Cons:
Not too strong in mobile computing
Speed limitations

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
In all domains we can use python especially in big data .
Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Variable is a name given to a memory location.
A=10

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Input(“The first number: “,a)
Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
integer
Q8. What is type casting?
Type casting means we can convert the data type of one variable in to another
Eg:a=10
Type(a) ---- INT
A_changed=float(a)
Type(A_changed)---Float
Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Yes
A,B=input(“Take the two numbers”).split()
Print(format(a,b))

Q10. What are keywords?
Keywords are reserved keys that has special meaning and purpose.


Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
No.
Eg:True,False
This can be used when we do logical operations and functions it itself has a special meaning


Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Spaces in the beginning of a code 
Indentation is used to know beginning and end  of a code.


Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
S=a+b;
Print(“the output is”,S)


Q14. What are operators in Python?
Operators are operations to do performance on variables.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
/--eg:15/2 it gives 7.5
//-7 only as output


Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```x = 'ineuron'

print(x * 5)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
A=10
B=5
If(A%B==0):
	print(“it is even”)
Else:
	Print(“it is odd”)


Q18. What are boolean operator?
To check if the variable is true or false


Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 --1

0 and 0--0

True and False and True--0

1 or 0 or 0--1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python
Conditional statements helps you to make a decision based on certain condition.



 
Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
If(a==5): 
       True
Elif(a==6): 
       True
Else:
        False—it checks if a comes under 5 and 6 then true otherwise false
Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
A=50
If(A>=18):
	Print(“"I can vote".)
If(A<18):
	Print(“"I can’t vote".)	


Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
sum = 0

for i in range(7):
    if numbers [i]%2 == 0:
        sum = sum + numbers [i]

print("\nSum of Even Numbers is", sum)


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

A=input(“first_number”,a)
B=input(“Second_number”,b)

C=input(“Third_number”,c)

If((A>B)&(A>C)):
	Print(“The biggest_number is”,A)
If((B>A)&(B>C)):
	Print(“The biggest_number is”,B)
If((C>A)&(C>B)):
	Print(“The biggest_number is”,C)





Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for num in numbers: 
	if num % 5 == 0: 
		print(num)
	if(num>150):
		continue
	if(num>500):
		break	


```
